Design Patterns:
Singleton Pattern: It allows to create only single instance of a class.
Factory Pattern: It allows to create classes based on properties on the fly.
Dependency Injection pattern: It manages dependencies among different classes.
Iterator Pattern: It allows to traverse the container irrespective of inherent nature of container.
